Hi Everyone

I'm back with another blog on Deep Dive into AWS Cloud Security from scratch.

**What is Cloud Security ?**          
* Cloud security is a set of policies, strategies, controls, procedures, and practices designed to **safeguard** the data, resources, and applications hosted on the **cloud**.

**Why to Learn Cloud Security ?**
* Cloud security is critical since most **organizations** are already using cloud computing in one form or another. 
* Worldwide **end-user** spending on public cloud services is forecast to grow **20.4% in 2022** to total **$494.7 billion**, up from **$410.9 billion** in **2021**, according to the latest forecast from [Gartner, Inc](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-500-billion-in-2022#:~:text=IaaS%2C%20DaaS%20and%20PaaS%20to,latest%20forecast%20from%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.)

From the above statistics, it shows **Amazon AWS** dominates the cloud industry, so i decided to start with _AWS Cloud Security_, but :(

So i started to look where i can **create and deploy** a **vulnerable** cloud enviroment for learning,i end up by finding [CloudGoat](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat).
