**Breaching AWS Labs**

* The Course showcases more than 40 AWS different resources/services including 20 cloud specific attack vectors and remediation. 
* The Breaching AWS labs simulate a fictional corporation “**TwoCapital**” hosting its infrastructure on the AWS environment.
* Based on past cloud breaches the challenges have a variety degree of difficulty and solving them will lead to the total compromise of the target cloud environment.
* The aim is to breach “**TwoCapital**” company and move laterally, exploit weak AWS configurations/policies and find a way to compromise the super secure Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).
* The Lab also contains all the Necessary Tools that are required to solve the Labs under `/Desktop/Tools/` Folder

**My Experience**

* Enrolled for the Breaching AWS Course on `Jan 12th, 2024`, received a form where we need to Provide the **Start Date of the Lab**.

* On `Jan 14th 2024` early morning, i received my lab access, it also contained the CloudBreach Lab Rule Do's & Don'ts.

* I Started the Lab around `Jan 15th 2024` and was able to complete the labs within Few Days, since i had worked on solving AWS Cloudgoat before.

* CloudBreach portal contains `Set of Quiz`, upon solving the lab you will be able to answer the quiz questions (these quiz are considered to be flags).

* The Course Content PDF contains all the necessary information required to Solve the Labs, Starting from **Unauthenticated AWS Enumeration** to **Compromise the Infrastructure** using the misconfigurations.

* I was very confident by solving the labs and Scheduled the exam on `Feb 23rd 2024` around `7.15 am`.

* Received the email instructions with `Exam Objective` and access to Exam Environment. The Exam Objective was just Few Lines, i was like okay Let's Do this !

</p>

* The `Inital Foothold` just took couple of mins to get some information from Unauth AWS Enumeration, After that i did a small stupid mistake took `3 hours` to move laterally in the infrastructure.

* After gaining `root` privilege in a system i was happy thought the exam is over. checked with the CloudBreach Team confirmed that i was still at the `Starting Stage` of the exam.

* Further enumeration led me into a Rabbithole and stuck there for sometime
