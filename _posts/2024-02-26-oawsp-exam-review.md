* The Course showcases more than 40 AWS different resources/services including 20 cloud specific attack vectors and remediation.

* The Breaching AWS labs simulate a fictional corporation “**TwoCapital**” hosting its infrastructure on the AWS environment.

* Based on past cloud breaches the challenges have a variety degree of difficulty and solving them will lead to the total compromise of the target cloud environment.

* The aim is to breach “**TwoCapital**” company and move laterally, exploit weak AWS configurations/policies and find a way to compromise the super secure Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).

* The Lab also contains all the Necessary Tools that are required to solve the Labs under **/Desktop/Tools/** Folder.

* On **Jan 14th 2024** early morning, i received my lab access, it also contained the CloudBreach Lab Rule Do's & Don'ts.

* I Started the Lab around **Jan 15th 2024** and was able to complete the labs within Few Days, since i had worked on solving AWS Cloudgoat before.

* CloudBreach portal contains **Set of Quiz**, upon solving the lab you will be able to answer the quiz questions (these quiz are considered to be flags).

* The Course Content PDF contains all the necessary information required to Solve the Labs, Starting from **Unauthenticated AWS Enumeration** to **Compromise the Infrastructure** using the misconfigurations.

* I was very confident by solving the labs and Scheduled the exam on **Feb 23rd 2024** around **7.15 am**.

* The **Inital Foothold** just took couple of mins to get some information from Unauth AWS Enumeration, After that i did a small stupid mistake took **3 hours** to move laterally in the infrastructure.

* Further enumeration led me into a Rabbithole and stuck there for sometime.
