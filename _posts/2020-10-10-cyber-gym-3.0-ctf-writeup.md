Hello everyone , i am back with an another CTF blog , but this time as a creator and organiser of the event.

Me and few of my colleagues [Aravind Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a6avind/) and [Moksh Makhija](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moksh-makhija/) are from different domain **Web**,**Android** and **Network**,so we thought of bringing challenges from each domain so that people will enjoy solving the challenges and learn new things from other domains as well.

<p align="center">The CTF challenge is based on <strong>Ricky & Morty</strong> theme </p>

<p align="center">

</p>

The CTF format was in jeopardy. which has all type of challenges such as **Pwn, Web, Android , Network , OSINT, General**.

Rules for the CTF are quite simple. __No automated scripts allowed , No Nmap allowed , No dirbuster allowed , Nothing allowed__ which creates heavy traffic.

Note : “The more you solve the points of the challenges get decrease due to the dynamic pointing system”

<p align="center">This blog contains the “Best Write up” Submitted for each challenge</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Category : Web</strong></p>
<p align="center">Game Over</p>

Team Name: **Shinobies**

Let’s open the given URL for the Challenge. <http://challenges.lucideus.in:4444>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web1.png">
</p>

On visiting the URL of the Challenge it was a static Page with a single Image on it which was not enough for a start, let’s see what we can get in the source code of the webpage.

__Right-click > View Page Source__

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web2.png">
</p>

At first glance, it looks like there is nothing but if you look closely, there’s more than what is shown on the page. On scrolling the page we can see a comment.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web3.png">

```bash
<!—S0 u W@nT T0 Pl@y– H3r3 1s Y0ur K3y– [.– …– .-.. -.-. —– — …– -.-. …. .- — .–.] —!>
```

So our key is in dots and dashes. On googling for **language with dots and dashes** we get Morse Code.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web4.png">
</p>

Lets search for “Morse Code Decoder”, use any tool to decode the morse-code <http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/morse-code/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web5.png">
</p>

On converting Morse Code to Text we get, **w3lc0m3champ**.

Navigating to the challenge’s URL <http://challenges.lucideus.in:1111> discloses the PHP code as shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web6.png">
</p>

It’s clear from the string **If you are SSRF, i will be there for you!** that we need to perform an SSRF attack in order to get the flag.

We can understand from the code that the GET parameter “a” would be required to get us through. Let’s see the components of the code used.

- The line $url = parse_url($_GET[‘a’]); indicates the use of PHP’s [parse_url](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php).

- The line $ch = curl_init();  indicates the use of PHP [cURL](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-init).

- The code requires hostname to be **c3483264cea221ce6fa7366baa358ea6e0aa6f61**.

With this information, we now learn that we need to bypass the hostname verification in order to  perform SSRF.

For understanding URL components and bypassing URL parsers to perform an SSRF, we would refer to [black hat’s presentation](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Tsai-A-New-Era-Of-SSRF-Exploiting-URL-Parser-In-Trending-Programming-Languages.pdf).

We’ll use the file and http protocol to read the flag from the server.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web7.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web8.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web9.png">
</p>

We’ll use this information to construct a URL for the bypass.

**http://challenges.lucideus.in:1111/?a=file://flag@localhost:80@c3483264cea221ce6fa7366baa358ea6e0aa6f61/flag**

**http://challenges.lucideus.in:1111/?a=file://flag@localhost:80@c3483264cea221ce6fa7366baa358ea6e0aa6f61/flag**

Even the below one works.

<p align="center">Fix It</p>

Team Name: **Shinobies**

Let’s open the given URL for the Challenge. <http://challenges.lucideus.in:1234>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web10.png">
</p>

As we can see, this page contains some jpg files.

Let’s open an Image and see what it looks like

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web11.png">
</p>

After opening 2-3 more pictures & looking at their size we figured out  that all images are the same. But there’s an Image with a different size which caught our eyes and we started digging into it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web12.png">
</p>

When trying to open that Image an error pops up.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web13.png">
</p>

The error says that the file cannot be displayed because it contains errors. So to figure out what can be the best possible way to bypass this error let’s download this Image and look at the metadata of the image (that might contain some information).

We can use multiple tools here to check the metadata of the Image like exiftool, binwalk etc…

Using **Exiftool** to view the metadata of the file.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web14.png">
</p>

And we found something suspicious about file format as It says “File Format error”.

Ok now we know that there’s a problem in file format of the Image, let’s check the signature of the Image with simple cat command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web15.png">
</p>

As it looks like we can’t proceed with the corrupted file, lets try fixing it.

To fix this error we need to change the signature of the corrupted file to JPEG file format.

__How to do it?__

Now, let’s inspect the Image and to analyse the hex of the file, goto https://hexed.it/ and upload the JPG file.

We found that the File Signature is manipulated and Instead of Original jpeg signature which is **FF D8 FF** it was **13 37 FF**

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web16.png">
</p>

You can see the file signature value from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web17.png">
</p>

After changing the file signature to its original signature download the newly generated file.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web18.jpg">
</p>

Lets try **exiftool** again on the fixed JPEG.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web19.png">
</p>

We get some metadata but none of it looks useful.

Might be possible that the flag is hidden in the image with help of any Steganography tool which leads us to another tool [Steghide](http://steghide.sourceforge.net/).

**Steghide** is used to hide secrets using Steganography.

```bash
steghide –info mortyfix.jpg
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web20.png">
</p>

It looks like there is some embedded data, lets try extracting it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web21.png">
</p>

But extracting it requires a password, we tried bruteforcing with some common password but no luck!

Lets google for **steghide Bruteforce**.

And there’s an amazing tool __StegCracker__ by Paradoxis which can do the job for you

With easy installation run it on the file with a wordlist like __rockyou.txt__

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web22.png">
</p>

After several attempts StegCracker gave us a password “ricky”. Now let’s again try to extract the embedded data with steghide.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/web23.png">
</p>

Steghide extracts a file **flag.txt** on printing the contents of the file we get the flag.

By Reading the Challenge Description and also being the first challenge it was looking easy to solve. So, Let’s go to the home-page of the challenge website: <http://cybergym.lucideus.in/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/general.png">
</p>

Now right-click and check the source code for this page and as we need to find flag for the following challenge let’s search for keyword **flag**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/general2.png">
</p>

Looks like we found a page **/flag**.

Now let’s append this in front of our URL and try opening it: **http://cybergym.lucideus.in/flag**.

**Step 1** : Download the packet capture rFTsim0eOAJyOencSqQdd97TaOzz7I1q6nLCcqNn from the challenge.

**Step 2** : Run Wireshark for this pcap file using the below command.

```bash
wireshark rFTsim0eOAJyOencSqQdd97TaOzz7I1q6nLCcqNn
```

**Step 3** : While observing the traffic to different IPs, one IP (10.11.1.4) traffic was found to be unusual which sent the request to the URI, /ACK. It had a different User-Agent as well that was using Simple HTTP Python server which stood out among other packets.

Following its TCP stream, and display it in hex format. The response body had the magic bytes of PKZIP (**50 4B 03 04**) which is of zip archives.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net3.png">
</p>

Click on **Save as**. button above and remove the line breaks and spaces to only have the hex bytes saved in a file.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net4.png">
</p>

Hex reverses the saved hex byte file to a binary file using the xxd command as shown below.

```bash
xxd -r -p <saved-hex-byte-file> <output-file>
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net5.png">
</p>

Rename the file to .zip and unzip the file. It complains that it cannot be done since the version is incompatible.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net6.png">
</p>

I googled and found <https://askubuntu.com/questions/596761/error-while-unzipping-need-pk-compat-v5-1-can-do-v4-6>.

Use **7z** instead.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net7.png">
</p>

Using 7z to extract the .zip file but the password was required.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net8.png">
</p>

Run **zip2john** on the encrypted zip file using the command **zip2john output.zip**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net9.png">
</p>

The hash can now be saved and cracked using john (John the Ripper) utility.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net10.png">
</p>

The password was found to be **123** as shown below.

Let’s Download the file and see what is it that Ricky bhai saw flying over the air.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net13.png">
</p>

The filename doesn’t say much about what is “Flying over the air”. Let’s use the “file” binary to check the filetype.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net14.png">
</p>

So, it looks like Ricky was talking about this tcpdump. 

For those who don’t understand what tcpdump is, it’s in the name “dump of TCP packets”.

Now, let’s move forward without judging you ;-). Google search the entire file type and see what google thinks about this filetype.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net15.png">
</p>

Oooh, I found something familiar, its **Wireshark**, which means I will be able to open this file with Wireshark (I think)

Just right click on the file and open with wireshark (if you have it already installed else install wireshark first)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net16.png">
</p>

Now, Ricky sailed something about “flying in the air”, in network terminology we would say wireless. Also, if you will just google 802.11 from the output of checking the filetype step.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net17.png">
</p>

Wireshark has an option for “Wireless” in the menu bar. Let’s see what it offers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net18.png">
</p>

Only one option for WLAN (Thank God)

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net19.png">
</p>

We found the SSID of the network. Looks very simple but can be the flag **cygym{Honor 8X}**

Spoiler alert: the flag is not **cygym{Honor 8X}**. Let’s try harder

Now, we decided to understand the packets a little bit. And since we need to be quick, we decided to sort the packets by info column and look at the different types of packets being transmitted and received.

- 802.11 Block Ack Req
- 802.11 Block Ack
- Acknowledgment
- Action
- Association Request
- Association Response
- Authentication
- Beacon Frame
- CF-end (Control Frame)
- Clear-to-Send
- Data
- Deauthentication
- Key

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net20.png">
</p>

Eureka, we found something
- A lot of deauthentication broadcast messages
- A complete 4-way handshake

Conclusions that came in our head after this:

- The MAC address of the source of deauthentication broadcasts is the **flag**. (We were trying everything that made sense even if it was not a cygym{} format, coz some machines didn’t have that and after a while, it was shared on the channel that this machine’s flag is not in the exact format)
- We need to get the pre-shared key and that will be the **flag**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/net21.png">
</p>

After failing with our attempt with the MAC address, we wanted to decrypt the pre-shared key.

To break the password, we will use one of the most popular Kali Linux tools. (If you haven’t heard of it before, just look at the default bookmarks of Mozilla browser in KALI)

Using aircrack-ng is pretty simple, we need to know the 
- BSSID of the channel
- One wordlist to brute-force the key
- **tcpdump** (Which we already have, Thanks to Ricky)

Now the only thing left was to execute aircrack-ng and see if we finally have the flag or not.

```bash
aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt -b d0:d7:83:cc:b8:f3 xswcdevfrbgtyhnujmil
```

Team Name: **Pynoobs**

We first check the details about the file using the file and the checksec command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn1.png">
</p>

We start with running the binary with ltrace in order to find out the dynamic library calls going on in the background.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn2.png">
</p>

We see that the input is compared to the string **Ho1d_4h3_D00r!**. Upon trying with the same string, we see that the response is an error message and the date command is run post that.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn3.png">
</p>

It’s now time to open the binary using [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

We directly jump on to check the string __Secret Please:__ as we saw in the prompt.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn4.png">
</p>

The string is found. We can now jump on to the location of the string.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn5.png">
</p>

In the decompiled code, we see that the string belongs to the function f.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn6.png">
</p>

It can be observed that the function uses gets and strcmp which are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

If we can recall from the checksec output, the NX is enabled. So, we can’t put our shellcode on the stack. 

To get a remote code execution, we would need to either use components from the code itself or otherwise do a ret2libc.

The first one sounds easier. Let’s see what we have from the binary.

Searching for **sh**, we find a reference to __/bin/rbash__.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn7.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn8.png">
</p>

Looking at the decompiled code, we see that the string belongs to a **function x** which looks quite interesting… 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn9.png">
</p>

A quick search for rbash shows us that it is a restricted bash shell. This now seems the perfect candidate for our exploit.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn10.png">
</p>

Recall the checksec output that shows PIE as disabled i.e no ASLR. This means that the address of all the functions would remain the same every time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn11.png">
</p>

Let’s plan for the exploit now by revisiting our vulnerable function i.e. f.

We observe that the return statement occurs after the strcmp returns. So, it’s evident that we need to exploit strcmp and that too after matching the KEY.

Also, we see that the buffer size is 256 bytes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn12.png">
</p>

From all the information gathered by now, we can predict the buffer format as shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn13.png">
</p>

Let’s use gdb to confirm this.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn14.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn15.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn16.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn17.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/cybergym3/pwn18.png">
</p>

Now, we create our final exploit using __pwntools__ and **python3**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3 from pwn import *
# p = process("./UpYnFAQNolbn0vxXftkPmSykV3QvZt")p = remote(”cybergym.lucideus.in”, 1337)
FUNCTION_X = p64(0x00401254)KEY = b"Ho1d_4h3_D00r! \x00"FILLER =  b"A" * (256-len(KEY))JUNK = b"B" * 8
payload = KEY + FILLER + JUNK + FUNCTION_X
p.recvuntil(”Secret Please:\n”)p.sendline(payload)p.interactive()
```
