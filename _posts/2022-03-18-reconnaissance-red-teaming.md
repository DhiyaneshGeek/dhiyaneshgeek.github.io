Hi Everyone

I'm back with another blog on how Reconnaissance is carried out in a Red Teaming Engagement.

**What is Reconnaissance ?**      
* Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve **adversaries actively** **or passively** gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Such information include details of the **victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel.**
