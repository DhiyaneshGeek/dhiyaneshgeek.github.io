Hey, Everyone!  
     I'm back with blog post, and this time I want to share my experience on **Code Review**, it all started from doing **PentesterLab** [Code Review Badge](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/codereview/course), It provides a solid foundation by initially focusing on understanding smaller code sections, then advancing to the comparison of code changes through patch differentials, and ultimately culminating in a thorough grasp of the entire source code.          
     In this blog post we will be focus on _Patch Diff Analysis_ part.

**What is Patch Diff ?**
