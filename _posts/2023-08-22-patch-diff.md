Hey, Everyone! 

I'm back with blog post, this time will be focus on _Patch Diff Analysis_ part.

**What is Patch Diff ?**

**"patch"** or **"diff"** , is a utility used in software development and version control systems to compare two sets of files and identify the differences between them. The term "diff" is short for "difference.‚Äù

**Syntax for Diff**

```bash
diff <option> <original_file> <modified_file> > <patch_file>
```

More options can be found here [Options to diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/diff-Options.html)

To generate a diff use the **diff** command in `Unix/Linux`, you typically use the following format:

```bash
diff -u <original_file> <modified_file> > <patch_file>
```
Here's what each part of the command means:

- `diff` : This is the command itself, which is used to compare files and generate the patch diff.
- `u` : This option tells **diff** to use the unified diff format, which is the most commonly used and human-readable format for patches.
- `<original_file>` : This is the path to the original file, the one you want to compare against.
- `<modified_file>` : This is the path to the modified file, the one you have made changes to.
- `>` : This is the output redirection symbol that saves the generated patch diff to a file.
- `<patch_file>` : This is the name of the file where the patch diff will be saved.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we have two text files, **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**, and we want to generate a patch diff (see what codes are changed) between them:

**file1.txt**

```bash
This is the original text.
```

**file2.txt**

```bash
This is the modified text.
```

We can use the **diff** command to generate the patch diff:

```bash
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > my_patch.diff
```

This command will compare **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**, and the output will be redirected to a file named **my_patch.diff**. 

The content of **my_patch.diff** will look like this:

```bash
--- file1.txt	2023-07-23 10:00:00.000000000 -0400
+++ file2.txt	2023-07-23 10:00:00.000000000 -0400
@@ -1 +1 @@
-This is the original text.
+This is the modified text.
```

- **---** and **+++** indicate the file names and timestamps.
- **@@** provides information about the line numbers and context of the changes.
- **-** and **+** represent the lines removed and added, respectively.

In this example, the diff shows that the original line was removed, and the modified line was added.
