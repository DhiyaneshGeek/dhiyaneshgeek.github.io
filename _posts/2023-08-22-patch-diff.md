Hey, Everyone! </br>

I'm back with blog post, this time will be focus on _Patch Diff Analysis_ part.

**What is Patch Diff ?**

**"patch"** or **"diff"** , is a utility used in software development and version control systems to compare two sets of files and identify the differences between them. The term "diff" is short for "difference.‚Äù

To generate a patch diff using the `diff` command in `Unix/Linux`, you typically use the following format:

```bash
diff -u <original_file> <modified_file> > <patch_file>
```
Here's what each part of the command means:

- **diff**: This is the command itself, which is used to compare files and generate the patch diff.
- **u**: This option tells **`diff`** to use the unified diff format, which is the most commonly used and human-readable format for patches.
- **<original_file>**: This is the path to the original file, the one you want to compare against.
- **<modified_file>**: This is the path to the modified file, the one you have made changes to.
- **>**: This is the output redirection symbol that saves the generated patch diff to a file.
- **<patch_file>**: This is the name of the file where the patch diff will be saved.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we have two text files, file1.txt and file2.txt, and we want to generate a patch diff (see what codes are changed) between them:

file1.txt

```file
This is the original text.
```

file2.txt

```file
This is the modified text.
```

We can use the `diff` command to generate the patch diff:

```bash
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > my_patch.diff
```

This command will compare **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**, and the output will be redirected to a file named **my_patch.diff**. 

The content of my_patch.diff will look like this:

```file
--- file1.txt	2023-07-23 10:00:00.000000000 -0400
+++ file2.txt	2023-07-23 10:00:00.000000000 -0400
@@ -1 +1 @@
-This is the original text.
+This is the modified text.
```

- **---** and **+++** indicate the file names and timestamps.
- **@@** provides information about the line numbers and context of the changes.
- **-** and **+** represent the lines removed and added, respectively.

In this example, the diff shows that the original line was removed, and the modified line was added.
